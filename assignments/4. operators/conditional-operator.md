1.  🎖Make a simple calculator with these functions. Using prompt, type conversion, if else statement. Use prompt to take the input from user i.e two numbers and an operation (Add, Sub, Mul, Div).

  ⛑ Rule
    * [ ] While substracting and dividing keep in mind the number one should be greater then number two. If not show alert saying `Number Two is larger then Number one`.
  ⚡️ Operations
    * [ ] Add
    * [ ] Sub
    * [ ] Mul
    * [ ] Div

2. 🎖Write a if else statement which checks if the status is single `console.log` the message `John is single` or else `John is married`
```js
var firstName = 'John';
var status = 'single';
// Your code goes here
```

3. 🎖Write a JavaScript program that takes two `integers` from user (using prompt) and alerts the larger number.
```js
// your code goes here
```

4. 🎖Write a JavaScript conditional statement to find the sign (+, -) of product of three numbers. Take those three numbers from user using `prompt`. Display an alert box with the specified sign.

```js
// Your code goes here
